SKETCH A

I decided I wanted to create a night sky to keep time. I experimented with different periods but I wanted all three elements to be visible so I set the night sky to lighten over 60 seconds, the moon to cycle through its phases every 30 seconds, and the starts to twinkle every second. I also used this assignment to go back and use beginShape to make a star that could be filled in. I don't know if there is a way to use beginShape to create a function where I could have a diameter that could be easily changes? I had to make more use of comments than I normally do to keep track of all the different components; I also had to play around with the order of shapes to make everything visible. It also took me a while to figure out how I wanted the stars to move; I tried a slight rotation and movement but decided two stars alternating was the most "twinkly."

I am very proud of this one and had a lot of fun doing it! It feels like this was the first coding assignment I did where I could envision something original and execute it. I'd like to figure out how to make things move back and forth with sin/cos.
